Bear Monitoring App

The Bear Watch project will provide an application to collect data for analysis to answer important questions and define the consequences of human and bear interaction in the protected areas that BC Parks manage. 

The Bear Watch application will allow users in the field to collect data on bear and bear-viewer behavior in bear-viewing areas. The data collected from Bear Watch will be housed in centralized storage within the MoE (Ministry of Environment). The data will be retrieved in a searchable and sortable format by BC Parks analysts. This will provide BC Parks with data that will help them make decisions pertinent to the management of bear viewing areas.

## Features

The primary goals of the Bear Watch System are to effectively and accurately collect raw data in the field which will be exported in a comma separated values (CSV) file with compressed pictures via email to the Project Sponsor. The data will be formatted to be compatible with integration to the Wildlife Species Inventory Database by the MoE.

## Goals/Roadmap

The Bear Watch application is essentially a form that can be completed in a dynamic environment that can rapidly change. With this in mind, the system will be designed for easy navigation and quick response to user input. The application will incorporate principles of Human Computer Interaction to present users an easy to use and learn interface.
